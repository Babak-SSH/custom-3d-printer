# Custom 3D Printer
A custom RepRap FDM 3D printer inspired by Ender.

⚠️ Still under active development: Parts and documentation will change!

## V1.0

The first version is more like a proof of concept designed and made out of mostly scraped metal over the course of 6 month, however it is fully functional and practical but there is more to enhance and improve.
